#Todo List <br> for improvements in the future

---
[✅] `done`, `delete`, `deadline`, and `event` commands not working 
    with 1 or more whitespace (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException)

[ ] More abstraction

[ ] Need more S L A P P in methods

[✅] `todo` + empty space generates task with whitespace as taskName

[✅] `engageUser()` to handle parsing then commands, separately

[✅] If load file is blank, no message on whether file was loaded 
    successfully or not

[ ] Consider which methods to be `public` or `private`
